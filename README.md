# The summary
YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers
to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions
of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary
patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean
expression which determine its logic.
